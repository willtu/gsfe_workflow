# A high-throughput computation framework for generalized stacking fault energies of pure metals
This is the workflow for calculating GSFE (Genralized Stacking Fault Energy) which is based on Materials Project's [pymatgen](https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen), [fireworks](https://github.com/materialsproject/fireworks), [custodian](https://github.com/materialsproject/custodian) and [atomate](https://github.com/hackingmaterials/atomate).

## Getting Started
Before using these workflow scripts, you need to install atomate and deploy the cluster, which can refer to the [official document](https://atomate.org/installation.html). 

## Versioning
This is a beta version, we will update and synchronize it in the future, welcome to follow and fork us, thanks for your attention.
